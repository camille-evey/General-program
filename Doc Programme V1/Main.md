I used Qt with a custom qss stylesheet (MyStyle.qss). 
The aim here is to have an interface with multiple tabs, each allowing the user to interact with different instruments, and see some datas.

Here, we are basically compiling all tabs in the main interface. 
### class Fenetre
The main window of the programm.
#### constructors
```python
class Fenetre()
```
creates the Fenetre object

#### imports
